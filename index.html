<p>TINHuB is a process to install and extend the version of PHP found on your existing Macintosh computer (usually with Mac OS X Server installed) to include some functionality it does not come with out of the gate. Specifically speaking, it provides a much improved version of GD and mCrypt. Other features are available but these two are default optimizations. The idea was born out of a desire to be able to do Drupal development on the standard OS X install of PHP but that was not possible beginning with OS X Yosemite due to GD no longer being compiled in and future versions being gimped. </p>

<a id="this-is-not-homebrew-or-macports" class="anchor" href="#this-is-not-homebrew-or-macports" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>This Is Not HomeBrew (or MacPorts)</h3>

<p>This is an important note. We do not use HomeBrew or Macports or any other dependency injecting mechanism. We compile against some binaries already on the system and upgrade some that need upgrading. We also provide the stock versions of PHP for the system you may be compiling for but realistically you should be able to compile any version of PHP for any version of Mac OS X. This installer will not bloat your system with needless binaries or dependencies just to upgrade your web server.</p>

<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Getting started can be as easy as downloading the installer and running it (as sudo) in the terminal. For systems with SIP (System Integrity Protection) turned on, you will need to turn this off before proceeding. There was thoughts of working around this, but it would be required for those upgrading to PHP 5.6 or PHP 7 anyway (due to the upgrade to LibreSSL). </p>

<p>To disable System Integrity Protection this, boot to your restore image (restart holding down Apple-R keys) and go to the Utilities menu. Select the terminal option and on the command line type:</p>

<p>csrutil disable</p>

<p>Then you will need to re-start and you should be able to install without further issue.</p>

<p>TINHuB was developed by Michael Bagnall (<a href="https://github.com/ElusiveMind" class="user-mention">@ElusiveMind</a>) beginning in 2015. In June of 2016, the project was revamped to a single branch and installer and the process for installing PHP 7 also became available. </p>
